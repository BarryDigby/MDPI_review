Introns are spliced out of RNA transcripts as lariat structures, and then are typically debranched and rapidly degraded. Here, we describe an unusual spliced intron from the constant region of the T cell receptor-β (TCR-β) locus that is relatively stable in mammalian cells. This intron, IVS1 cβ1 , accumulates as a set of lariat RNA structures with different length talls in the nucleus of T cells. The accumulation of this spliced intron is developmentally regulated during murine thymocyte ontogeny. The property of stability appears to be evolutionary conserved since the human version of this intron also accumulates in T cells. The stability is selective since other spliced TCR-β introns do not detectably accumulate in T cells. The unusual stability of this intron does not depend on T cell specific factors since non-T cells transfected with TCR-β gene constructs also accumulate spliced IVSI cβ1 . The discovery of a mammalian intron that accumulates as a lariat in vivo provides an opportunity to elucidate mechanisms that regulate intron debranching, stability, and nuclear localization. }",

Statistical estimates and biochemical assays provided strong evidence that a substantial fraction of the spliced transcripts from hundreds of genes are circular RNAs.

By reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, it is now shown that the only exons present in the scrambled transcript are exons 2, 3, and 4 and that this molecule lacks a poly(A)+ tail. Furthermore, the use of PCR primers in both orientations of either exon 2 or exon 4 revealed that the orders of the exons in the scrambled transcript are 2-3-4-2 and 4-2-3-4, respectively. These results, combined with the observation that P450 2C24 is a single-copy gene, with no duplication of the exon 2 to exon 4 segment, suggest that the scrambled transcript has properties consistent with that of a circular molecule. In line with this is the observation of an increased resistance of the transcript to phosphodiesterase I, a 3{\textquoteright}-exonuclease. Moreover, an alternatively processed cytochrome P450 2C24 mRNA, lacking the three scrambled exons and having exon 1 directly joined to exon 5, has been identified in kidney and liver, tissues that express the scrambled transcript. This complete identity of the exons that are absent in the alternatively processed mRNA but present in the scrambled transcript is interpreted as indicative of the possibility that exon scrambling and exon skipping might be interrelated phenomena. It is therefore proposed that alternative pre-mRNA processing has the potential to generate not only mRNAs lacking one or more exons but also circular RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Summary
We describe the identification and characterization of circular intronic long noncoding RNAs in human cells, which accumulate owing to a failure in debranching. The formation of such circular intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) can be recapitulated using expression vectors, and their processing depends on a consensus motif containing a 7 nt GU-rich element near the 5′ splice site and an 11 nt C-rich element close to the branchpoint site. In addition, we show that ciRNAs are abundant in the nucleus and have little enrichment for microRNA target sites. Importantly, knockdown of ciRNAs led to the reduced expression of their parent genes. One abundant such RNA, ci-ankrd52, largely accumulates to its sites of transcription, associates with elongation Pol II machinery, and acts as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription. This study thus suggests a cis-regulatory role of noncoding intronic transcripts on their parent coding genes.}
